Description of the datasets, including size and features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Summary of EDA findings, including visualizations and key observations.
## Data Preprocessing
* Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
* Feature engineering and transformations applied to the data.
## Model Selection
List of machine learning algorithms used, including:

* Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
* Regression: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.
* Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering.
## Model Evaluation
Metrics used for evaluation (e.g., MAE, RMSE, accuracy) and comparison of model performance.

## Limitations
* Overfitting risk due to the retention of all features.
